                            <p class="card-text">At the beginning of our Westpac Hackathon journey, I reached out to four teammates: Owen, Percy, Nathan, and Maxi. 
                                I carefully selected each person, considering the unique strengths they could bring to our project.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Owen</strong> is a PhD student specializing in Python and machine learning, which is why I felt he would be a tremendous asset to 
                                our team. His expertise in these areas seemed perfectly aligned with the technical challenges we anticipated for our Westpac project, especially given our focus on AI-driven features.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Percy, Nathan, and Maxi are fellow students in my cohort. <strong>Percy</strong> has two years of work experience, and I believed her practical insights and familiarity with project management would be invaluable in structuring our work and setting realistic timelines.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Nathan</strong> stood out for his exceptional language skills. He's meticulous, and his serious approach to work made him an ideal choice to 
                                enhance our team's communication. Since my other teammates are non-native English speakers, I saw Nathan as someone who could ensure our documentation and explanations were clear and persuasive.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Maxi</strong>, whom Percy introduced to the team, previously worked as a game planner. I was hopeful that his imaginative and creative approach could inject some fresh, unconventional ideas into our project. In a competition 
                                where "innovative thinking" is essential, I felt having someone with his background would give us an edge.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Together, I believed this team, with its rich diversity of skills and perspectives, would enable us to tackle the hackathon challenges from multiple angles. Each member brought their unique expertise to the table, creating a well-rounded and dynamic group. With Owen’s technical prowess, Percy’s project experience, Nathan’s communication finesse, and Maxi’s creative vision, I felt confident that we had assembled a team capable of not only competing but also standing out in a meaningful way. 
                                I was excited to see how these combined strengths would drive us toward building something impactful, innovative, and truly unique.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">At the beginning of team formation, everyone felt a bit lost. The timing was challenging since we were just coming off the final exam week, and most of us were still recovering from that intense period. As the team leader, it was essential to set goals to keep everyone on track and avoid losing direction. We decided to hold at least one fixed meeting every week, as we had roughly a month from forming the team to the competition. In the early meetings, we focused on brainstorming, encouraging everyone to share their ideas freely. Our discussions revolved around key questions like:</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><li>"What ideas could be most impactful?" </li>
                                <li>"How can we leverage this project to help banks?"</li>
                                <li>"Which technologies can our team realistically implement?"</li></p>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">We spent nearly two weeks refining our concept, eventually deciding on creating an inclusive virtual AR interaction environment that could facilitate seamless access to banking services for all users. Our focus was to develop a solution that not only leverages cutting-edge technology but also makes banking more accessible and user-friendly, especially for people with disabilities or language barriers. This vision drove us to conceptualize a system that combines VR, gesture recognition, 
                                and AI-driven features for a more intuitive and immersive user experience.</p>

                    <div class="card mb-5">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">Once our goals were clear, distributing tasks became much easier. With each team member’s strengths in mind, we allocated roles accordingly:</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Percy</strong> took on the role of front-end development, responsible for building 
                                the virtual environment and creating interactive scenes within the VR space.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Owen</strong>with his background in machine learning as a PhD student, focused on developing and 
                                training the gesture recognition language model.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Maxi</strong>explored the implementation of text-to-speech and voice synthesis functionalities to enable smooth interactions with the AI.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I managed the back-end infrastructure, setting up servers and integrating various components, such as gesture recognition and voice processing, to ensure seamless communication between the front end and back end.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Nathan</strong> handled meeting notes and documentation, ensuring our plans and progress were well-documented and that our communication was clear and organized.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">By aligning our tasks with individual strengths, we created a solid foundation that enabled us to build a coherent, impactful project. Our teamwork, combined with regular meetings and clear objectives, allowed us to overcome initial uncertainty and work effectively toward our shared goal.</p>

                    <h5 class="mb-5 pb-4 text-danger">Overcoming Challenges</h5>
                    <div class="card mb-5">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">Our team collaboration was not without its challenges; we faced several obstacles along the way.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">One of the biggest hurdles was coordinating everyone's schedules. Each team member had different work and sleep routines, making it difficult to find a common time for discussions. To address this, I implemented two solutions. First, we relied heavily on online meetings through Teams, which eliminated the need for physical meetups and allowed for more flexibility. Second, I ensured that meeting notes and updates were regularly posted, 
                                so even those who couldn't attend could stay up-to-date and aligned with our progress.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">On the technical side, we encountered numerous difficulties. Each team member had expertise in different programming languages, which posed a challenge for maintaining efficiency. We realized that using different languages would only slow us down, so after much discussion, we agreed to standardize on Python—a language we had all learned at Griffith. 
                                The abundance of existing training models in Python also made it a strategic choice.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">However, this decision created a new challenge: Nathan wasn't proficient in Python, and he initially felt discouraged by this choice, as it made it difficult for him to keep up in the short term. Recognizing that each team member was essential and that contributing didn't necessarily mean coding, I worked to boost Nathan’s morale and reassigned tasks to leverage his strengths. 
                                This approach allowed him to contribute meaningfully without needing to code.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">By continuously encouraging and involving each team member, we ultimately fostered a strong sense of cohesion within the team, making us more resilient and united as we approached the competition.</p>

                    <h5 class="mb-5 pb-4 text-danger">Presentation and Final Pitch</h5>
                    <div class="card mb-5">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">While we were confident in our project, the joy of learning that we had made it to the final pitch was indescribable. However, the excitement quickly turned into urgency, as we realized that we needed to present our work the very next day at the Gold Coast. None of us had prepared a script, so I immediately took on the task of drafting one, 
                                while Percy focused on preparing the slides for our presentation.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">At 8 PM that evening, we held a quick meeting to discuss our presentation strategy for the following day. Interestingly, Percy and I had a bit of a disagreement over some aspects of the presentation. However, after a heated but constructive discussion, we reached a consensus. I’ve always believed that a bit of tension can be healthy for a team; it shows that people care and are passionate about the project. 
                                When team members freely express their opinions and engage in lively debates, it often leads to a better, more polished outcome.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The next day, our presentation went smoothly. We showcased our project with confidence, and Nathan, with his exceptional speaking skills, played a crucial role in emphasizing the strengths and innovations of our solution. 
                                Each team member contributed brilliantly, and we felt proud to have given it our all.</p>

                    <h5 class="mb-5 pb-4 text-danger">Winning the Competition</h5>
                    <div class="card mb-5">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">On presentation day, we were surrounded by an impressive array of creative and well-executed projects. One team from QUT particularly stood out to me. They had built a massive mod in Minecraft, incorporating playful elements designed to attract children and help them understand complex banking concepts like investments and financial planning. The focus was on learning through play, 
                                and their project was a wonderful example of how education and entertainment can be seamlessly integrated.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">As we watched each presentation, it became clear that every team had put immense effort into their work. It was both inspiring and intimidating to see so many innovative ideas. But when it came time for our turn, we presented our project with passion, 
                                believing that our focus on inclusivity and accessibility gave us a unique edge.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">When the judges announced our project as the winner, we were ecstatic. Knowing that we had stood out among so many brilliant projects was incredibly rewarding. Our team's hard work, late-night meetings, and perseverance had paid off. Winning first place not only validated our vision for a more accessible banking experience but also highlighted the impact that inclusive technology can have. 
                                It was a proud moment for us all, and we left with a renewed sense of purpose and excitement for what’s next.</p>
