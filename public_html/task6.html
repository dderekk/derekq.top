                            <p class="card-text">During my time at Griffith University as a sessional academic tutor, I was responsible for teaching two courses: Software Technologies (2810ICT/7810ICT) and Mathematics for Computer Science (1013ICT). My role involved leading workshops, mentoring students, and guiding them through complex programming, data visualization, and mathematical concepts. As a tutor, I was tasked with making difficult 
                                topics approachable while ensuring that students had the tools they needed to succeed in hands-on projects and exams.</p>

                            <img class="card-img-top" src="./assets/WIL/task5.1.png" alt="Blog image">
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p class="card-text">In the Software Technologies course, I focused on introducing students to key software development practices such as version control, scripting techniques, and testing strategies. I also helped them navigate the complexities of data visualization using Python’s Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. In Mathematics for Computer Science, I facilitated workshops that emphasized problem-solving, calculus, and C programming, helping students apply theoretical knowledge to practical coding challenges. 
                                I sometimes offered individual guidance to students, ensuring they understood the core concepts and were able to apply them confidently.</p>
                            
                            <p class="card-text">My teaching experience helped students build both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in programming and mathematics. I saw noticeable improvements in students’ confidence and performance as they engaged more deeply with their coursework. Several students expressed gratitude for the hands-on approach I used, which made difficult topics more understandable and less intimidating. My role not only positively impacted students' learning outcomes but 
                                also honed my own skills in communication, mentorship, and adapting complex information for diverse learning styles.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">This tutoring experience reinforced my belief in the importance of effective communication and teaching in technical fields. I developed a deeper understanding of how to break down complex concepts into digestible parts and how to motivate students to engage with challenging material. The role also highlighted the value of continuous learning, as I frequently had to refine my own understanding to answer student questions comprehensively. This experience has solidified my commitment to fostering a 
                                collaborative and supportive learning environment, which I believe is key to success in any technical field.</p>
